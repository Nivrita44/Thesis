Vanya and Vova are playing a game. Players are given an integer n. On their turn, the player can add 1 to the current integer or subtract 1. The players take turns; Vanya starts. If after Vanya's move the integer is divisible by 3, then he wins. If 10
 moves have passed and Vanya has not won, then Vova wins.
Write a program that, based on the integer n, determines who will win if both players play optimally.

Input
The single line of test case contains the integer n (1≤n≤1000).

Output
For test case, print "First" without quotes if Vanya wins, and "Second" without quotes if Vova wins.
