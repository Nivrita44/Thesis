D. Pippy is preparing for a "black-and-white" party at his home. He only needs to repaint the floor in his basement, which can be represented as a board of size n×m
.

After the last party, the entire board is painted green, except for some k
 cells (x1,y1),(x2,y2),…,(xk,yk)
, each of which is painted either white or black. For the upcoming party, D. Pippy wants to paint each of the remaining green cells either black or white. At the same time, he wants the number of pairs of adjacent cells with different colors on the board to be even after repainting.

Formally, if
A={((i1,j1),(i2,j2)) | 1≤i1,i2≤n,1≤j1,j2≤m,i1+j1<i2+j2,|i1−i2|+|j1−j2|=1,color(i1,j1)≠color(i2,j2)},
where color(x,y)
 denotes the color of the cell (x,y)
, then it is required that |A|
 be even.

Help D. Pippy find the number of ways to repaint the floor so that the condition is satisfied. Since this number can be large, output the remainder of its division by 109+7
.

Input

The first line of each test case contains three integers n,m,k
 (3≤n,m≤109
; 1≤k≤2⋅10^5
) — the dimensions of the board and the number of cells that are initially not green.

In the i
-th of the following k
 lines of each test case, there are three integers xi,yi
 and ci
 (1≤xi≤n;1≤yi≤m
; ci∈{0,1}
) — the coordinates of the cell and its color (if white, then ci=0
; if black, then ci=1
). It is guaranteed that all cells are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of k
 across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5
.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the answer modulo 10^9+7
.
