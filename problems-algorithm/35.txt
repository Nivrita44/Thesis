You are given two integers n and k.

In one operation, you can subtract any power of k from n. Formally, in one operation, you can replace n by (n−kx) for any non-negative integer x.

Find the minimum number of operations required to make n equal to 0.

Input
The only line of test case contains two integers n and k (1≤n,k≤10^9).

Output
For test case, output the minimum number of operations on a new line.
