Given an integer n, find an integer x such that:2≤x≤n.The sum of multiples of x that are less than or equal to n is maximized. Formally, x+2x+3x+⋯+kx where kx≤n
 is maximized over all possible values of x.
Input
test case contains a single integer n (2≤n≤100).

Output
For test case, output an integer, the optimal value of x. It can be shown there is only one unique answer.
