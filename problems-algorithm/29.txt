You are given a four-digit pin code consisting of digits from 0 to 9 that needs to be entered. Initially, the cursor points to the digit 1. In one second, you can perform exactly one of the following two actions:
Press the cursor to display the current digit,
Move the cursor to any adjacent digit.

The image contains "1234567890"
The image above shows the device you are using to enter the pin code. For example, for the digit 5, the adjacent digits are 4 and 6, and for the digit 0, there is only one adjacent digit, 9.

Determine the minimum number of seconds required to enter the given four-digit pin code.

Input
The single line of test case describes the pin code as a string of length 4, consisting of digits from 0 to 9.

Output
For test case, output the minimum number of seconds required to enter the given pin code.
