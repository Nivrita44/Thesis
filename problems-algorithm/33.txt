You're given an array a initially containing n integers. In one operation, you must do the following:

Choose a position i such that 1<i≤|a| and ai=|a|+1−i, where |a| is the current size of the array.
Append i−1 zeros onto the end of a.
After performing this operation as many times as you want, what is the maximum possible length of the array a?

Input
The first line of test case contains n
(1≤n≤3⋅10^5) — the length of the array a.

The second line of test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤10^12).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.

Output
For test case, output a single integer — the maximum possible length of a after performing some sequence of operations.
