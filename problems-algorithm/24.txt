Let's consider all integers in the range from 1 to n (inclusive).
Among all pairs of distinct integers in this range, find the maximum possible greatest common divisor of integers in pair. Formally, find the maximum value of gcd(a,b), where 1≤a<b≤n.

The greatest common divisor, gcd(a,b), of two positive integers a and b is the biggest integer that is a divisor of both a and b.

Input
The only line of  test case contains a single integer n (2≤n≤10^6).

Output
For test case, output the maximum value of gcd(a,b) among all 1≤a<b≤n
