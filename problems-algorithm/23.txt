You are given three integers x,y and n. Your task is to find the maximum integer k such that 0≤k≤n that kmodx=y, where mod 
is modulo operation. Many programming languages use percent operator % to implement it.In other words, with given x,y and n you need to find the maximum possible integer from 0 to n
 that has the remainder y modulo x.

Input
The only line of the test case contains three integers x,y and n (2≤x≤10^9; 0≤y<x; y≤n≤10^9).
It can be shown that such k always exists under the given constraints.

Output
For test case, print the answer — maximum non-negative integer k such that 0≤k≤n and k mod x=y. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.
