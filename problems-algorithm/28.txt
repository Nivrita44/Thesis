There are three cells on an infinite 2-dimensional grid, labeled A, B, and F. Find the length of the shortest path from A to B if:
in one move you can go to any of the four adjacent cells sharing a side;visiting the cell F is forbidden (it is an obstacle).

Input
test case contains three lines. The first one contains two integers xA,yA (1≤xA,yA≤1000) — coordinates of the start cell A .
The second one contains two integers xB,yB (1≤xB,yB≤1000) — coordinates of the finish cell B. 
The third one contains two integers xF,yF (1≤xF,yF≤1000) — coordinates of the forbidden cell F. All cells are distinct.

Coordinate x
 corresponds to the column number and coordinate y
 corresponds to the row number (see the pictures below).

Output
Output the length of the shortest path from the cell A to the cell B if the cell F is not allowed to be visited.
