Given an integer x
 and an integer k
. In one operation, you can perform one of two actions:

choose an integer 1≤a≤k
 and assign x=x⋅a
;
choose an integer 1≤a≤k
 and assign x=xa
, where the value of xa
 must be an integer.
Find the minimum number of operations required to make the number x
 equal to y
, or determine that it is impossible.

Input

The only line of each test case contains three integers x
, y
 and k
 (1≤x,y,k≤10^6
).

It is guaranteed that the sum of x
 and the sum of y
 across all test cases does not exceed 10^8
.

Output
For each test case, output −1
 if it is impossible to achieve x=y
 using the given operations, and the minimum number of required operations otherwise.
