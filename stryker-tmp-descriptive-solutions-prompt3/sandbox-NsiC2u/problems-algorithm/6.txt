You are given an array a that contains n integers. You can choose any proper subsegment al,al+1,…,ar of this array,
meaning you can choose any two integers 1≤l≤r≤n , where r−l+1<n . We define the beauty of a given subsegment as the 
value of the following expression:
max(a1,a2,…,al−1,ar+1,ar+2,…,an)−min(a1,a2,…,al−1,ar+1,ar+2,…,an)+max(al,…,ar)−min(al,…,ar).

Please find the maximum beauty among all proper subsegments.

Input
The first line of test case contains a single integer n (4≤n≤10^5) — the length of the array.
The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤10^9) — the elements of the given array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output
For a testcase print a single integer — the maximum beauty of a proper subsegment.
