    Rayan wants to present a gift to Reyhaneh to win her heart. However, Reyhaneh is particular and will only accept a k-harmonic set of permutations.

We define a k-harmonic set of permutations as a set of k
 pairwise distinct permutations p1,p2,…,pk
 of size n
 such that for every pair of indices i
 and j
 (where 1≤i,j≤n
), the following condition holds:

p1[i]+p2[i]+…+pk[i]=p1[j]+p2[j]+…+pk[j]

Your task is to help Rayan by either providing a valid k-harmonic set of permutations for given values of n
 and k
 or by determining that such a set does not exist.

We call a sequence of length n
 a permutation if it contains every integer from 1
 to n
 exactly once.

Input
Each test case consists of two integers n
 and k
 (1≤n,k≤10^5
). The sum of n⋅k
 over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅10^5
.

Output
For each test case, if a k-harmonic set of permutations exists, print YES on the first line. Then, print k
 lines, each containing a distinct permutation of the integers from 1
 to n
.

If no such set exists, print NO on the first line.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.
