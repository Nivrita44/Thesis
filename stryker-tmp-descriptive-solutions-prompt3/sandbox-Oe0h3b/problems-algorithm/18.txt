Let LCM(x,y) be the minimum positive integer that is divisible by both x and y. For example, LCM(13,37)=481, LCM(9,6)=18.You are given two integers l and r. Find two integers x
 and y such that l≤x<y≤r and l≤LCM(x,y)≤r.

Input
test case is represented by one line containing two integers l and r (1≤l<r≤109).

Output
For test case, print two integers:
if it is impossible to find integers x and y meeting the constraints in the statement, print two integers equal to −1;
otherwise, print the values of x and y (if there are multiple valid answers, you may print any of them).
