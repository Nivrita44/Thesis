You are fighting a monster with z
 health using a weapon with d
 damage. Initially, d=0
. You can perform the following operations.

Increase d
 — the damage of your weapon by 1
, costing x
 coins.
Attack the monster, dealing d
 damage and costing y
 coins.
You cannot perform the first operation for more than k
 times in a row.

Find the minimum number of coins needed to defeat the monster by dealing at least z
 damage.

Input


The only line of each test case contains 4 integers x
, y
, z
, and k
 (1≤x,y,z,k≤10^8
) — the first operation's cost, the second operation's cost, the monster's health, and the limitation on the first operation.

Output
For each test case, output the minimum number of coins needed to defeat the monster.
