Sparkle gives you two arrays a
 and b
 of length n
. Initially, your score is 0
. In one operation, you can choose an integer i
 and add ai
 to your score. Then, you must set ai
 = max(0,ai−bi)
.

You only have time to perform k
 operations before Sparkle sets off a nuclear bomb! What is the maximum score you can acquire after k
 operations?

Input

The first line of each test case contains n
 and k
 (1≤n≤2⋅10^5,1≤k≤10^9
) — the length of the arrays and the number of operations you can perform.

The following line contains n
 integers a1,a2,...an
 (1≤ai≤10^9
).

The following line contains n
 integers b1,b2,...bn
 (1≤bi≤10^9
).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 for all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5
.

Output
For each test case, output an integer, the maximum score you can acquire after k
 operations.
