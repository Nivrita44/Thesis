You are given an array of n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
. You are also given an array p1,p2,…,pn
.

Let S
 denote the random multiset (i. e., it may contain equal elements) constructed as follows:

Initially, S
 is empty.
For each i
 from 1
 to n
, insert ai
 into S
 with probability pi/10^4
. Note that each element is inserted independently.
Denote f(S)
 as the bitwise XOR of all elements of S
. Please calculate the expected value of (f(S))2
. Output the answer modulo 10^9+7
.

Formally, let M=10^9+7
. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction pq
, where p
 and q
 are integers and q≢0(modM)
. Output the integer equal to p⋅q−1modM
. In other words, output such an integer x
 that 0≤x<M
 and x⋅q≡p(modM)
.

Input

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
 (1≤n≤2⋅10^5).

The second line of each test case contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤1023
).

The third line of each test case contains n
 integers p1,p2,…,pn
 (1≤pi≤10^4).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105


Output
For each test case, output the expected value of (f(S))2
, modulo 10^9+7.
