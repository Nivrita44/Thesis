You are given two non-negative integers x
 and y
.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): choose a positive integer k
 and divide either x
 or y
 by 2k
 rounding down. The cost of this operation is 2k
. However, there is an additional constraint: you cannot select the same value of k
 more than once.

Your task is to calculate the minimum possible cost in order to make x
 equal to y
.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤10^5
) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x
 and y
 (0≤x,y≤10^17
).

Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum possible cost in order to make x
 equal to y.
