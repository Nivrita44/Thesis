Pak Chanek has a prime number† n. Find a prime number m such that n+m is not prime.

† A prime number is a number with exactly 2 factors. The first few prime numbers are 2,3,5,7,11,13,…. In particular, 1 is not a prime number.

Input
The only line of test case contains a prime number n (2≤n≤10^5).

Output
For test case, output a line containing a prime number m (2≤m≤105) such that n+m is not prime. It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, such m always exists.

If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.
