Even Little John needs money to buy a house. But he recently lost his job; how will he earn money now? Of course, by playing a game that gives him money as a reward! Oh well, maybe not those kinds of games you are thinking about.
There are n+m
 distinct points (a1,0),(a2,0),…,(an,0),(b1,2),(b2,2),…,(bm,2)
 on the plane. Initially, your score is 0
. To increase your score, you can perform the following operation:

Choose three distinct points which are not collinear;
Increase your score by the area of the triangle formed by these three points;
Then, erase the three points from the plane.

Let kmax
 be the maximum number of operations that can be performed. For example, if it is impossible to perform any operation, kmax
 is 0
. Additionally, define f(k)
 as the maximum possible score achievable by performing the operation exactly k
 times. Here, f(k)
 is defined for all integers k
 such that 0≤k≤kmax
.

Find the value of kmax
, and find the values of f(x)
 for all integers x=1,2,…,kmax
 independently.

Input


The first line of each test case contains two integers n
 and m
 (1≤n,m≤2⋅10^5
).

The second line of each test case contains n
 pairwise distinct integers a1,a2,…,an
 — the points on y=0
 (−10^9≤ai≤10^9
).

The third line of each test case contains m
 pairwise distinct integers b1,b2,…,bm
 — the points on y=2
 (−10^9≤bi≤10^9
).

It is guaranteed that both the sum of n
 and the sum of m
 over all test cases do not exceed 2⋅10^5
.

Output
For each test case, given that the maximum number of operations is kmax
, you must output at most two lines:

The first line contains the value of kmax
;
The second line contains kmax
 integers denoting f(1),f(2),…,f(kmax)
. You are allowed to omit this line if kmax
 is 0
.
Note that under the constraints of this problem, it can be shown that all values of f(x)
 are integers no greater than 10^16
.
