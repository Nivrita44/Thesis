You have obtained the new limited event character Xilonen. You decide to use her in combat.

There are n
 enemies in a line. The i
'th enemy from the left has health hi
 and is currently at position xi
. Xilonen has an attack damage of m
, and you are ready to defeat the enemies with her.

Xilonen has a powerful "ground stomp" attack. Before you perform any attacks, you select an integer p
 and position Xilonen there (p
 can be any integer position, including a position with an enemy currently). Afterwards, for each attack, she deals m
 damage to an enemy at position p
 (if there are any), m−1
 damage to enemies at positions p−1
 and p+1
, m−2
 damage to enemies at positions p−2
 and p+2
, and so on. Enemies that are at least a distance of m
 away from Xilonen take no damage from attacks.

Formally, if there is an enemy at position x
, she will deal max(0,m−|p−x|)
 damage to that enemy each hit. Note that you may not choose a different p
 for different attacks.

Over all possible p
, output the minimum number of attacks Xilonen must perform to defeat at least k
 enemies. If it is impossible to find a p
 such that eventually at least k
 enemies will be defeated, output −1
 instead. Note that an enemy is considered to be defeated if its health reaches 0
 or below.

Input
The first line contains an integer t
 (1≤t≤10^4
) – the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n
, m
, and k
 (1≤k≤n≤105
, 1≤m≤10^9
).

The following line contains n
 integers h1,h2,...,hn
 (1≤hi≤10^9
).

The last line of each testcase contains n
 integers x1,x2,...,xn
 (1≤xi≤10^9
, xi<xi+1
 for all 1≤i<n
)

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 105
.

Output
For each test case, output an integer on a new line, the minimum number of attacks that must be performed to defeat at least k
 enemies. If it is impossible to find a p
 such that eventually at least k
 enemies will be defeated, output −1
 instead.
