You are given a connected undirected graph, the vertices of which are numbered with integers from 1
 to n
. Your task is to minimize the number of pairs of vertices 1≤u<v≤n
 between which there exists a path in this graph. To achieve this, you can remove exactly one edge from the graph.

Find the smallest number of pairs of vertices!

Input
Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤10^4
) — the number of sets of input data. Then follows their description.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n
 and m
 (2≤n≤10^5, n−1≤m≤min(10^5,n⋅(n−1)/2)
) — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges.

Each of the next m
 lines contains two integers u
 and v
 (1≤u,v≤n,u≠v
), indicating that there is an undirected edge in the graph between vertices u
 and v
.

It is guaranteed that the given graph is connected and without multiple edges.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 and the sum of m
 over all sets of input data does not exceed 2⋅10^5
.

Output
For each set of input data, output the smallest number of pairs of reachable vertices, if exactly one edge can be removed.
