Vanya has a graph with n
 vertices (numbered from 1
 to n
) and an array a
 of n
 integers; initially, there are no edges in the graph. Vanya got bored, and to have fun, he decided to perform n−1
 operations.

Operation number x
 (operations are numbered in order starting from 1
) is as follows:

Choose 2
 different numbers 1≤u,v≤n
, such that |au−av|
 is divisible by x
.
Add an undirected edge between vertices u
 and v
 to the graph.
Help Vanya get a connected∗
 graph using the n−1
 operations, or determine that it is impossible.

∗
A graph is called connected if it is possible to reach any vertex from any other by moving along the edges.

Input

The first line of each test case contains the number n
 (1≤n≤2000
) — the number of vertices in the graph.

The second line of each test case contains n
 numbers a1,a2,⋯an
 (1≤ai≤10^9).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 2000
.

Output
For each test case, if there is no solution, then output "No" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes), and then output n−1
 lines, where in the i
-th line, output the numbers u
 and v
 that need to be chosen for operation i
.

You can output each letter in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).
