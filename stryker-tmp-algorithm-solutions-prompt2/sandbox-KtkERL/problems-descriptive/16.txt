You are given a string s
 consisting of characters A and B.

Your task is to split it into blocks of length 1
 and 2
 in such a way that

there are no more than a
 strings equal to "A";
there are no more than b
 strings equal to "B";
there are no more than ab
 strings "AB";
there are no more than ba
 strings "BA";
Strings "AA" and "BB" are prohibited. Each character of the initial string s
 should belong to exactly one block.

Input


The first line of each test case contains a single string s
 (1≤|s|≤5⋅10^5
) consisting only of characters A and/or B.

The second line of each test case contains four integers a
, b
, ab
, and ba
 (0≤a,b,ab,ba≤5⋅10^5
) — the maximum allowed number of strings "A", "B", "AB", and "BA" correspondingly.

It's guaranteed that the total length of s
 doesn't exceed 5⋅10^5
 over all test cases.

Output
For each test case, print YES if it's possible to split string s
. Otherwise, print NO.
