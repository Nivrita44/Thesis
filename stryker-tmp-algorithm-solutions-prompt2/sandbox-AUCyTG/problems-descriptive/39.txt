We call a sequence a1,a2,…,an
 magical if for all 1≤i≤n−1
 it holds that: min(a1,…,ai)≥mex(ai+1,…,an)
. In particular, any sequence of length 1
 is considered magical.

The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers a1,a2,…,ak
 is defined as the smallest non-negative integer t
 which does not occur in the collection a
.

You are given a sequence a
 of n
 non-negative integers. Find the maximum possible length of a magical subsequence∗
 of the sequence a
.

∗
A sequence a
 is a subsequence of a sequence b
 if a
 can be obtained from b
 by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.

Input

The first line of each test case contains an integer n
 (1≤n≤2⋅10^5
) — the length of the sequence a
.

The second line of each test case contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (0≤ai≤10^9
) — the elements of the sequence a
.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5
.

Output
For each test case, output a single number — the maximum possible length of a magical subsequence of the sequence a
