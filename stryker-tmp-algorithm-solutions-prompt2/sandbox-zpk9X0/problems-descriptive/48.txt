There are n
 cities in a row, numbered 1,2,…,n
 left to right.

At time 1
, you conquer exactly one city, called the starting city.
At time 2,3,…,n
, you can choose a city adjacent to the ones conquered so far and conquer it.
You win if, for each i
, you conquer city i
 at a time no later than ai
. A winning strategy may or may not exist, also depending on the starting city. How many starting cities allow you to win?

Input


The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
 (1≤n≤2⋅10^5
) — the number of cities.

The second line of each test case contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤n
) — the deadlines for conquering the cities.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5
.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer: the number of starting cities that allow you to win.
