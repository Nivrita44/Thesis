Shohag has an integer n. Please help him find an increasing integer sequence 1≤a1<a2<…<an≤100 such that ai mod i≠ aj mod j ∗ is satisfied over all pairs 1≤i<j≤n.

It can be shown that such a sequence always exists under the given constraints.

∗amodb denotes the remainder of a after division by b. For example, 7 mod 3=1,8 mod 4=0 and 69 mod 10=9.

Input
The first and only line of test case contains an integer n (2≤n≤50).

Output
For test case, print n
 integers — the integer sequence that satisfies the conditions mentioned in the statement. If there are multiple such sequences, output any.
