There is a regular polygon with n sides (n≥3). The vertices are indexed as 1,2,…,n in clockwise order. On each vertex i,
 the pink soldiers have written a positive integer ai. With this regular polygon, you will play a game defined as follows.

Initially, your score is 0. Then, you perform the following operation any number of times to increase your score.

Select 3 different vertices i, j, k that you have not chosen before, and draw the triangle formed by the three vertices.
 . Then, your score increases by ai⋅aj⋅ak
 . However, you can not perform this operation if the triangle shares a positive common area with any of the triangles drawn previously.

 Your objective is to maximize the score. Please find the maximum score you can get from this game.

Input


The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
 — the number of vertices (3≤n≤400
).

The second line of each test case contains a1,a2,…,an
 — the integers written on vertices (1≤ai≤1000
).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n3
 over all test cases does not exceed 4003
.

Output
For each test case, output the maximum score you can get on a separate line.
