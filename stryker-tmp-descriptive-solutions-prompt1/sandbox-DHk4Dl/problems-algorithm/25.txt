You are given a sequence a1,a2,…,an. Each element of a is 1 or 2.Find out if an integer k exists so that the following conditions are met.
1≤k≤n−1, and a1⋅a2⋅…⋅ak=ak+1⋅ak+2⋅…⋅an.
If there exist multiple k that satisfy the given condition, print the smallest.

Input
The first line of test case contains one integer n (2≤n≤1000).
The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤2).

Output
For test case, if there is no such k, print −1.

Otherwise, print the smallest possible k.
