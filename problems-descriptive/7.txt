One day, a giant tree grew in the countryside. Little John, with his childhood eagle, decided to make it his home. Little John will build a structure on the tree with galvanized square steel. However, little did he know, he could not build what is physically impossible.
You are given a rooted tree∗
 containing n
 vertices rooted at vertex 1
. A pair of vertices (u,v)
 is called a good pair if u
 is not an ancestor†
 of v
 and v
 is not an ancestor of u
. For any two vertices, dist(u,v)
 is defined as the number of edges on the unique simple path from u
 to v
, and lca(u,v)
 is defined as their lowest common ancestor.

A function f(u,v)
 is defined as follows.

If (u,v)
 is a good pair, f(u,v)
 is the number of distinct integer values x
 such that there exists a non-degenerate triangle‡
 formed by side lengths dist(u,lca(u,v))
, dist(v,lca(u,v))
, and x
.
Otherwise, f(u,v)
 is 0
.
You need to find the following value:
∑i=1n−1∑j=i+1nf(i,j).

∗
A tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree is a tree where one vertex is special and called the root.

†
An ancestor of vertex v
 is any vertex on the simple path from v
 to the root, including the root, but not including v
. The root has no ancestors.

‡
A triangle with side lengths a
, b
, c
 is non-degenerate when a+b>c
, a+c>b
, b+c>a
.

Input

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
 (1≤n≤3⋅10^5
).

Each of the next n−1
 lines contains two integers ui
 and vi
, denoting the two vertices connected by an edge (1≤ui,vi≤n
, ui≠vi
).

It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5
.

Output
For each test case, output the answer on a separate line.
