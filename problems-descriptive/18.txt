You are given two matrices A
 and B
 of size n×m
, filled with integers between 0
 and 109
. You can perform the following operations on matrix A
 in any order and any number of times:

&=: choose two integers i
 and x
 (1≤i≤n
, x≥0
) and replace each element in row i
 with the result of the bitwise AND operation between x
 and that element. Formally, for every j∈[1,m]
, the element Ai,j
 is replaced with Ai,j & x
;
|=: choose two integers j
 and x
 (1≤j≤m
, x≥0
) and replace each element in column j
 with the result of the bitwise OR operation between x
 and that element. Formally, for every i∈[1,n]
, the element Ai,j
 is replaced with Ai,j | x
.
The value of x
 may be chosen differently for different operations.

Determine whether it is possible to transform matrix A
 into matrix B
 using the given operations any number of times (including zero).

Input

Each test case is given as follows:

the first line contains two integers n
 and m
 (1≤n,m≤10^3
; n⋅m≤10^3
) — the dimensions of the matrices A
 and B
;
the following n
 lines describe the matrix A
, where the i
-th line contains m
 integers Ai,1,Ai,2,…,Ai,m
 (0≤Ai,j≤10^9
);
the following n
 lines describe the matrix B
, where the i
-th line contains m
 integers Bi,1,Bi,2,…,Bi,m
 (0≤Bi,j≤10^9
).
Output
For each test case, output Yes if it is possible to transform the matrix A
 into the matrix B
; otherwise, output No. Each letter can be output in any case, upper or lower.
